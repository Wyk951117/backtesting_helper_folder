# backtesting_helper_folder
This repo stores some helper files for backtesting

## temp_strategy_class.py
Can be a reference for creating your own strategy class for backtesting. The name of the class in your python file should be exactly the same as that in this file since it is the only class that would be created an instance of.

## server-client demo
This is a playground to test some new features of the server-client interaction environment. Also can be a reference to be more clear 
about how your strategy file and strategy class would be imported and called during the process.
